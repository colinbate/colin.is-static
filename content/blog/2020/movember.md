It has been a long time since I participated in Movember. The main reason being that I’ve had a beard for so long and wasn’t keen on shaving it. But given a recent encounter with prostate cancer within the family I thought it was about time. For those not familiar, Movember is an annual event to raise money and awareness for men’s health. People usually participate by growing or attempting to grow a mustache (or ‘mo’).

In addition to the usual mustache, I’m also hosting a couple of thematic D&D one-shot adventures. If you are interested then please get in touch.

And since I seem to have already committed myself, I will issue an additional challenge. If I get over $200 in donations, then I will dye my mustache purple at the end of the month. And keep it that way for at least 24 hours. I’m already over half way there, so it would only take a couple more donations to make it.

My official Movember page is available via:
