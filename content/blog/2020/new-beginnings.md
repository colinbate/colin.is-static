Happy New Year everyone.

I didn't add much to this site in 2019, but I'm hoping to improve that this year. And to that end I'm writing this entry on my new iPad Pro.

How will that help? I'm not really sure yet, but I'm looking forward to seeing if I can create a workflow which will allow me to get content from my brain onto the web in a faster and smarter way.

At the moment I'm using Working Copy + GoCoEdit as a decent solution, but this isn't any better than what I was doing on my Macbook.

Perhaps I can give Netlify CMS another go.

And I still want to get my project showcase site up. Plus updates to a number of those projects. Where will I find the time? Perhaps if I read fewer than 155 books this year.

Until then, I hope the new year brings many good things to everyone reading.
