As I mentioned in my [last post]({{< ref "space-opera.md" >}}), I like to read escapist fiction. When you go through books at the rate that I do, it is always good to be able to discover new books reliably. One way to do this is from personal recommendations by people with a similar taste in books.

I use [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com) to track my books, which helps considerably. They also attempt to provide recommendations for new books as well. One aspect of the site that I haven't really taken advantage of is the social side. You can have discussions about particular books or authors as well as being able to create groups for people to join.

That's all well and good, but I was trying to find out if there was any groups in Bermuda. There are, but they are either not active, or specific to a group which doesn't include me. Even outside of Goodreads, when I search Google for book clubs in Bermuda, I only get results for a library club, and another one from ~10 years ago.

So I guess what I'm doing is making an appeal to any fans of mystery, thriller or sci-fi books who live in Bermuda. I'm not looking to create a nice little book club (necessarily), but rather just find some folks to make recommendations. People who like the same books, and who may want to have a conversation about books we've all read.

So if you are interested in this kind of genre specific club/meeting/online group, do let me know.
