It has been just one day shy of a year since I last posted. In that time I had grand plans of creating an automated system where I would capture fun links and save them somewhere and automatically generate the posts and emails to send out each week. Well, it turns out I just didn't have the free time or energy to really get that sorted out.

That said, I have been using [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in) to save any links I think are worth talking about, so at least I have a decent backlog to work with. The biggest challenge I have now is maintaining the mailing list to send these out to. I've tried so many tools in the past year, that the list is fragmented and scattered. Not that it was really big to start with. So I'm going to post this on my site, and email it to a few parties I think will be interested.

That said, on with the show. Where in this case the show is a very random set of links, with no real theme.

### Angular 6 Release
https://blog.angular.io/version-6-of-angular-now-available-cc56b0efa7a4

On May 3, Google released version 6 of their popular Angular web application framework. This version consolidates satellite projects like Angular CLI all up to the same version (6). It also uses RxJS 6 which introduces a slightly different syntax, but one which allows for much more efficient bundling of libraries and applications. You can also watch the presentation from Google I/O about what's new and coming in Angular:

### Up
https://up.docs.apex.sh/

This isn't the Pixar movie, this is a tool for easily deploying your applications onto AWS. Unlike some similar tools which come with their own hosting service, Up simply uses your own AWS account meaning you pay for only the AWS usage. Under the hood, it loads your app into a lambda, so you get free initial usage out of that and afterward the cost is quite low. Up itself is available as the free open source version, or a $20/month Pro version which has some extra features. Also, this isn't for every type of application:

> Up currently supports Node.js, Golang, Python, Java, Crystal, and static sites

Need a simple local database for your mobile or desktop application? Working with .NET? Then take a look at LiteDB. You can think of it like SQLite with a MongoDB/NoSQL API. This is free, even for commercial use.
