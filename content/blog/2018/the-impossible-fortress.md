I have a read a few "Young Adult" books in the past couple of years, and I'm not sure really what defines that category. Typically the characters are younger, presumably to be more relatable. They tend to be less dark, less violent, but I guess that wouldn't necessarily always be the case. I guess where I'm going with this is the fact that many of them are well written, enjoyable stories. The Impossible Fortress drops us into the world of high school freshmen in 1987. A time before the World Wide Web, a time before information was ubiquitous, available at the swipe of a finger.

Part romance, part heist, part coming of age, and perhaps for some, part nostalgia. This isn't deep literature, but a fun story with some interesting twists and enjoyable characters.
