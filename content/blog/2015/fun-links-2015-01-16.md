Welcome to 2015 and what will hopefully be a year of technological excitement.

Hopefully I can start things off relatively well with a couple of micro JavaScript libraries that I've found that I think are exciting.

**page.js**  
http://visionmedia.github.io/page.js/  
There are lots of JavaScript frameworks which provide routing capabilities, but what if you only need a router, and not a framework. Then take a look at page.js which is just that in a tiny package. Only 1.2Kb with a syntax which will be familiar to most users of other JS based routers.

**aja.js**  
http://krampstudio.github.io/aja.js/  
Ajax without the XML. A small library which supports JSON and JSONP requests using a fluent API. Makes a nice little REST client.

**Slang**  
https://github.com/devongovett/slang  
A collection of JavaScript string functions. Some are things I find myself wanting from time to time so it may be nice to have on hand.

Happy New Year
