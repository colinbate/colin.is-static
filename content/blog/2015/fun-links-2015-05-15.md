A functional reactive library, a new web browser and a new-school take on old school build processes. I hope that people find something interesting here.

**Flyd**  
https://github.com/paldepind/flyd  
The minimalistic but powerful, modular, functional reactive programming library in JavaScript. With reactive programming being in vogue at the moment, there are a number of libraries popping up in various languages. I'm certainly no expert, but I like the API on this one. Quite functional (and therefore very composable) with a number of convenient optional modules you can pull in.

**Vivaldi**  
https://vivaldi.com/  
A new web browser built from HTML, CSS and Node.js. Created by the former CEO of Opera, this is a browser designed for power users. Has built-in note taking, email, sync and host of other features that make this a unique offering. If nothing else you don't get more meta than creating a browser using HTML.

**DIY**  
http://www.vittoriozaccaria.net/diy/  
A slightly different take on creating a web/JavaScript build system by allowing you to create a JS file that compiles into a `Makefile`. Of course, this is a bit more cumbersome for Windows users who would need to grab a copy of GnuWin's version of `make`, but it might appeal to some. The library has a number of the standard operations (minification, concatenation, etc.) built-in.
