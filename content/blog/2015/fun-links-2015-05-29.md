A DevOps tool, an IoT kit and a transcompiled JavaScript language. I'm hoping that people will find something interesting

A Mac app to manage your Docker containers in a visual way. Works side by side with the Docker CLI app.

Particle is an interesting Internet of Things toolkit. They provide hardware dev kits to prototype your ideas, and they have an online IDE, which allows you to edit and deploy firmware applications written in SparkJS and their Mobile SDK. Used to be called Spark.

**Earl Grey**

Earl Grey is a neat little language that compiles to JavaScript. It is still in development, but it has a concise syntax and might appeal to people, particularly with a Python background.
