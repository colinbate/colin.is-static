Over the holidays I worked on a web app. That isn't new, I do that most chances I get. However this app was an assignment, and I'd like to walk you through some of the lessons learned.

The assignment in this case was [one that I created myself][a]. I created it for some of my colleagues as a way to learn new web technologies without needing to worry about what to build. The goal was to recreate a simple app I had written years ago to request songs to add to my karaoke song list. Yes, I was an office karaoke jockey for a while.

The main part of the assignment aside from some specifications on functionality was that you needed to use at least two technologies that were new to you.
