Happy Friday everyone

Today there is a bit of a customer engagement theme to my links.

**Apostle.io**

Manage your transactional emails without needing a developer. Does your web app send emails? Would you like to better manage and track engagement with these emails? Then check out Apostle.io.

**cloudcannon**

A CMS for static sites without the CMS. I haven't tried this yet personally, but I know I've created sites for people in the past where this would have been ideal. Perhaps now you can stop making edits to sites of family members :)

**Sniply**

If you share a lot of content and links, then perhaps it would be nice to be able to embed a call to action in those links bringing people back to you or your products/services, etc.
