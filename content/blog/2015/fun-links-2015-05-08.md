Apologies, I've been out of the office for a while and I've fallen behind. I've been building up a backlog of links though, and so there should be a fairly steady stream for the next while.

**RethinkDB**  
http://rethinkdb.com/  
An open-source distributed database built with love. RethinkDB is built to store JSON documents, and scale to multiple machines with very little effort. It has a pleasant query language that supports useful queries like table joins and group by, and is easy to setup and learn.

**Gitbook**  
https://www.gitbook.com/  
A git and Markdown-based way to create books and distribute them. Generous terms and a freemium payment model, you can try it out for free.

**Codio**  
https://codio.com/  
Codio is a cloud-based IDE with a focus on education. They offer a free plan with 256MB of RAM and 2GB of disk space. As with any of the other Cloud IDEs I've mentioned before, it isn't always about specs. Features can vary subtly, and the IDE UIs are often a deciding factor when looking for something to suit your tastes. I've compared a number of the cloud IDEs lately, and this one ranks pretty highly if you are using Mercurial.
