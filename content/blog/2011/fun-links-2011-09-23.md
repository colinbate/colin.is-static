In an interest of spreading some knowledge and coolness around the dev team, I'm hoping to start sending out a collection of interesting links to technologies, OS projects and other similar things on a weekly basis. Topics will vary, but given my personal interests will likely be web focused. Perhaps people can send links to me through the week with a brief description so we can get more variety. They aren't necessarily related to work, but certainly could be relevant.
