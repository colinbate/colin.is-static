A geeky product, a non-geeky product and a link of links. Hopefully a bit of something for everyone.

**Fenix Webserver**  
http://fenixwebserver.com/  
Host multiple static sites on your machine with ease. Simplifies the management of different sites on your local machine over Apache, IIS or nginx. Also has a request watcher and data stub functionality so would certainly be useful for people developing browser based applications while working on the UI.

**U2Bear**  
https://github.com/shubapp/u2bear  
This one isn't so techy, it is a YouTube client application which supports downloading. Thought it might be time for something more fun. :)

**Queues**  
http://queues.io/  
Did you ever want to see a list of messaging or job queues in one place with links to resources about them? If so, then you will like this site.
