Sorry for the long time between posts, as everyone knows, it is a busy time. A bit of a random collection of links today.

**Magnum CI**  
https://magnum-ci.com/  
Simple easy to use hosted CI tool for building Ruby, php, node.js, and Go apps, running tests, etc. Could also be used to deploy the apps as well. Works with mercurial as well as git.

**TOML**  
https://github.com/toml-lang/toml  
Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language. TOML aims to be a minimal configuration file format that's easy to read due to obvious semantics. Like JSON only more human readable. Iâ€™ve been using it a fair bit lately and it is quite nice. There are a bunch of parsers listed on the GitHub page, but if you want to simply generate TOML from a JavaScript application (browser or node.js), I have created a library which will do that: https://bitbucket.org/colinbate/tomlify 

**Slack**  
https://slack.com/  
Slack is a platform for team communication: everything in one place, instantly searchable, available wherever you go. Slack is free to use for as long as you want and with an unlimited number of people.
