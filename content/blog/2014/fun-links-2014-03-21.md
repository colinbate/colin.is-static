Happy Friday everyone

Some more interesting collaborative services and apps.

**Kobra**  
https://kobra.io/  
Real time collaborative coding, with text and video chat. Currently in public beta.

**CoderPad**  
https://coderpad.io/  
CoderPad lets you instantly write and execute code collaboratively with an interviewee, right in the browser. Supports all the common languages including C# and JavaScript, so might be something we could use for interviews.

**Socrates.io**  
http://socrates.io/  
A simple real time Markdown editor and previewer. Very minimal but useful for quickly crafting documentation together, etc.

**Nitrous.io**  
[https://www.nitrous.io](https://www.nitrous.io/join/GxX1_n02UEs?utm_source=nitrous.io&utm_medium=copypaste&utm_campaign=referral)  
A real time development environment/server with an offline client and a Chrome app. (Disclosure: This link is a referral link, I get extra N2O if you sign up)

Have a good weekend.
