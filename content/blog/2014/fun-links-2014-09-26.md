A bit of a random collection today. Hopefully useful, although not necessarily very Orbis related.

**Digital Ocean**  
[https://www.digitalocean.com][0] (referral link)  
I realized that I haven't mentioned Digital Ocean before, and that is a shame because I find them to be an excellent VPS provider. If you want a quick and easy Linux cloud machine (known as a droplet), then look no further. They support a basic set of Linux distros as images, but they also have some application images as well. Need to get a LAMP or MEAN stack up and running quickly? Not a problem. Or for me, I created a Wordpress droplet (took about a minute) which I then had ready in a couple of minutes to test my `md2sp` tool. After I was finished testing, I destroyed the image and the whole thing only cost me 13Â¢. That was even cheaper than free when you consider the time it saved. I will mention that they have recently dropped support for Arch Linux, which I prefer, so if that is a factor, consider [Linode][1].

**Webhook**  
http://www.webhook.com  
"Webhook is the easiest way to build custom, editable websites." An interesting project that just came through Kickstarter, it is a CMS which builds down to a static site. Their business model essentially is their hosting, which ties into the product for a simple end to end experience. It is also open source and you can self-host for free. I've not had a chance to dig into this yet, but it seems promising.

**katon**  
https://github.com/typicode/katon  
Katon is a system (for the Mac) to manage your development servers and apps that you run locally and host them at a `.ka` domain locally on your machine. Great if you have a couple of node apps that you want to have running whenever you start your machine, and they aren't necessarily ready to setup `launchd` scripts for etc. Or you can use this as an alternative I suppose. I haven't used this yet, but if it does was it claims to do, it could be a nice time saver.
