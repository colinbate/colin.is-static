Happy Friday everyone!

Lots of interesting online IDEs and tools to play with:

**Gistbox**  
http://gistboxapp.com  
Manage your Github gists in a more organized way, share with teams and collect content with a Chrome extension.

**Discourse**  
http://www.discourse.org/  
Created by Jeff Atwood, Discourse is a community/discussion/forum platform which is open source and carrying a lot of potential.

**Compilr**  
https://compilr.com/  
Similar to Cloud9 (https://c9.io) which Iâ€™ve mentioned before.

**HTML5 Please**  
http://html5please.com/  
Not so much a tool as a reference for determining what and how to use from the suite of HTML "stuff".
