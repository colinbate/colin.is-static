**Heartbleed**
http://heartbleed.com  
Not really a fun link, but for anyone who hasn't heard there was a serious vulnerability announced this week around OpenSSL. Short story: change your passwords at places which are potentially affected.

**Metalsmith**
http://www.metalsmith.io/  
A plugin-based static site generator. I haven't used it yet, but the docs look good. Has a similar feel to Grunt and Gulp, two JavaScript task execution systems.

**Avow CI**  
http://avow-ci.com/ (this link is now dead)  
A small, simple CI tool built with Node.js and MongoDB. Built with JavaScript projects in mind, it integrates with GitHub, so if that is your setup, then this might be what you need. I'm tempted to fork a Mercurial supporting version.
