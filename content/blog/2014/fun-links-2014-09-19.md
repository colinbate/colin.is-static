Today things are static site themed. Why deploy a site with an expensive runtime if all of your pages are runtime static? With functionality moving increasingly to the browser, it is becoming popular to generate sites (like personal blogs, etc) out of some form of source content (often markdown files) and templates.

**Hugo**  
http://gohugo.io/  
A fast and modern static website engine written in Go. I’ve been using it for a couple of personal projects and it is pretty good. It uses Go Templates, which can be a bit tricky to work with. The tool is open source so if you need to tweak it for your needs you can.

**Swiftype**  
https://swiftype.com/  
Add search to your site… even works with static sites. There is a free plan available which should be good for personal blogs, etc.

**StaticGen**
https://www.staticgen.com/  
Lists and ranks a large collection of static site generators. If Hugo isn’t your thing, there are a number of others written in a variety of languages which might suit your next project.
