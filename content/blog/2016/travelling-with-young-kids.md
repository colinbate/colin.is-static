I recently travelled from Bermuda to Halifax, Canada via Toronto with a three and a half year old and an almost two year old. Boys. Just the three of us. If you've flown with young kids before, you are probably wincing right now. It could have been awful if not down right cataclysmic, but it went relatively well. Join me as I share my experience and some fatherly advice.

## Context

So as I mentioned, I was taking my kids (with my wife's consent) to visit their grandparents in Nova Scotia. Lacking a direct flight, this involves a three hour flight to Toronto (YYZ) and then a roughly two hour flight to Halifax (YHZ).

My three year old is a runner; he will take off running at any opportunity, and he is pretty fast. My one year old is not as fast, but he likes to climb on things, and still lacks some of the self-preservation instinct which makes that safe.

Most airlines allow you to carry an infant under the age of two on your lap. This usually means they are much cheaper or even free to fly. This was the case for me, and part of the reason I wanted to make this trip before my youngest turned two. 

## Be Prepared

I was a boy scout many years ago and our motto is very appropriate now. You can't just wing it for a trip like this. You need to have a plan.

Now, I'm a bit of a planner anyway when it comes to travel. I use [Workflowy](https://workflowy.com) to manage lists of items I want to pack. I even have a couple of packing list templates that I work from. For this trip, I started months in advance.

Even before I bought my ticket, I needed to assure myself that this feasible. I was less worried about how many shirts to take at this point, but about how to contain and entertain two active boys on my own, taking into account the luggage and in-flight supplies we would need.
