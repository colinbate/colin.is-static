I recently travelled from Bermuda to Halifax, Canada via Toronto with a three and a half year old and an almost two year old. Just the three of us. If you've flown with young kids before, you are probably wincing right now. It could have been awful if not down right cataclysmic, but it went relatively well. Join me as I share my experience and some fatherly advice.

## Context

So as I mentioned, I was taking my kids (with my wife's consent) to visit their grandparents in Nova Scotia. Lacking a direct flight, this involves a three hour flight to Toronto (YYZ) and then a roughly two hour flight to Halifax (YHZ).

## Be Prepared

I was a boy scout many years ago and our motto is very appropriate now. You can't just wing it for a trip like this. Now, I'm a bit of a planner anyway when it comes to travel. I use [Workflowy](https://workflowy.com) to manage lists of items I want to pack. I even have a couple of packing list templates that I work from. For this trip, I started over a month in advance.
