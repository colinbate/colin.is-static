**Online LATEX Collaboration**  
https://www.sharelatex.com/  
https://www.writelatex.com/  
A two pack of links to online tools which let you collaborate on writing LATEX documents. Slightly different offerings, but if you are an academic at heart, or just enjoy fine typesetting then take a look at what they have to offer.

**Emmet**  
http://emmet.io/  
Formerly known as Zen Coding, Emmet is a syntax (and plugin for many editors) to make working with HTML and CSS more streamlined. As Emmet it is available for Sublime Text and many other editors that you may be using. Visual Studio support is available via Web Essentials 2012 plugin. If you donâ€™t have this, you should get it. Information on the VS specific functionality is available in this post: http://www.johnpapa.net/zen-coding-in-visual-studio-2012/
