Moving away from JavaScript today, but not the web, I have a list of some alternative .NET projects for delivering web based content.

**Service Stack**  
http://www.servicestack.net/  
Thoughtfully architected, obscenely fast, thoroughly enjoyable web services for all. Tooling to augment or replace ASP.NET MVC or WCF for various web related tasks.

**Nancy**  
http://nancyfx.org/  
A lightweight framework for building HTTP based services, inspired by Sinatra (hence the name)

**Oak**  
http://amirrajan.github.io/Oak/  
Frictionless development for ASP.NET MVC single page web apps. Prototypical and dynamic capabilities brought to C#. Watch some of the videos (the first one is a nice example of a smooth development workflow).

**Simple.Data**  
https://github.com/markrendle/Simple.Data  
A light-weight, dynamic data access component for C# 4.0. If you want a simple way to get at data stored in a wide variety of relational and nosql sources, then take a look.
