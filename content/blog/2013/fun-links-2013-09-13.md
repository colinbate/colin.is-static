**OWASP .NET Cheat sheet**  
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/.NET_Security_Cheat_Sheet  
A list of useful security tips when developing .NET applications. At the bottom of the page is a list of links to other cheat sheets. Certainly worth a browse around. OWASP is generally a good resource for web security information.
