Hopefully some useful ones this time around, productivity tools and software development articles, so a bit different that my usual fare.

**Editr.js**  
http://lab.idered.pl/editr/  
Like Codepen or JsFiddle, but you host it yourselves. Great for demos, samples, etc.

**Trello**  
https://trello.com/colinbate/recommend (yes, I benefit if you sign up (it’s free))  
From the fine folks at Fog Creek, Trello is a tool for creating boards with lists and cards. Perfect for scrum, kanban or just planning your day. Lots of great features and all for free.

**Polyglot Persistence**  
http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PolyglotPersistence.html  
Talks about creating applications which use multiple storage systems to best solve the problems at hand. We/I’ve been using the term Hybrid Data, but this is something that I think we can benefit from even more than we are now.
