I had an extremely brief chance to look at the theme that came with Ghost and have duplicated it to start creating my own.

Feels like a Node app, which makes sense because it is one. The templates are basically Handlebar files, an index and a post template. Then there are assets. It is pretty simple. I suspect that we will see more in the future as more features are added.
