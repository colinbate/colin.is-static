**Audio Sort**  
http://skratchdot.github.io/audio-sort/index.html  
You studied them in school, you probably have used them in practice (usually via some library call), but have you heard them in action? I’m talking about sorting algorithms. Head over to Audio sort for some Friday fun as you listen to your favourite sorting algorithms arranging musical tones. You can even add your own algos. 

A purely JavaScript merge and comparison tool. Can be used directly from their site or more likely integrated into another app to provide comparison functionality.

**Repl.it**  
http://repl.it  
A web-based REPL (read-eval-print loop) for a variety of languages. Nice if you just want to test out a concept quickly.
