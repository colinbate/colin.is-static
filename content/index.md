## Developer

For the past 8 years, Colin has been employed by Orbis Investment Management Limited as a software developer working initially on internal software systems. Most of that time however he was working on a retail investment platform called [Orbis Access][oa].

In his spare time, Colin likes to hack on [node.js][njs] and [AngularJS][ng] and is currently investigating Scheme and whatever else his little spare time permits. Anything publicly available will be located on [bitbucket][bb] or possibly [github][gh]
