				<h1>Colin Bate is...</h1>
				<div class="main-content">
					

<p>Colin is a father, husband, software and web developer, user experience designer, team leader, occasional photographer and wannabe writer. He is a technology agnostic fan of all things related to the web and web applications. He also has a great passion for travel, and more specifically enjoys living in different places around the world.</p>

<p>Colin can be <a href="http://www.colinbate.com/contact">contacted by email</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/rhuvok">followed on Twitter</a>.</p>

<h2 id="developer:d680e8a854a7cbad6d490c445cba2eba">Developer</h2>

<p>Colin has been developing for the web for 21 years. Throughout university, he wrote and maintained an application platform in PHP called echo! He did freelance work during this time as well, including developing an e-commerce system for <a href="http://www.savanaspa.com">Savana urban spa</a> in London, UK.</p>

<p>For the past 10 years, Colin has been employed by Orbis Investment Management Limited as a software developer working on a mix of internal software systems and public facing web applications.</p>

<p>In his spare time, Colin likes to hack on <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a>, <a href="http://angular.io">Angular</a>, <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>, and is currently investigating Scheme and whatever else his little spare time permits. Anything publicly available will be located on <a href="https://bitbucket.org/colinbate/">bitbucket</a> or <a href="https://github.com/colinbate/">github</a></p>

<h2 id="writer:d680e8a854a7cbad6d490c445cba2eba">Writer</h2>

<p>Colin has maintained personal weblogs since 2001 which ranged in topic from personal reflection to travel commentary to technical tips. These sites have encompassed his <a href="http://www.rhuvok.com">undergraduate</a>, <a href="http://www.europeadventure.ca">graduate</a> and <a href="http://www.colinbate.com">professional</a> life. He briefly wrote about his life in Bermuda at <a href="http://canuckinbermuda.com">canuckinbermuda.com</a> and currently posts random technical tidbits and links at <a href="https://colin.is/blog/">colin.is/blog</a>.</p>

<p>Although not often as desired, Colin also does a bit of creative writing and aspires to write some short stories with the eventual goal of finishing a novel.</p>

<h2 id="photographer:d680e8a854a7cbad6d490c445cba2eba">Photographer</h2>

<p>Colin is an avid amateur photographer who shoots Canon and enjoys event, portrait, landscape and macro photography. Other than the photos scattered throughout his personal sites, Colin usually shares his photos <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/rhuvok">on Flickr</a>. His photo taking has unfortunately slowed down with two young children to look after. Unless you mean photos of his kids. :)</p>

<h2 id="personal:d680e8a854a7cbad6d490c445cba2eba">Personal</h2>

<p>Colin lives on the beautiful island of Bermuda in the mid-Atlantic with his wife and two sons. He enjoys movies, <a href="http://bermudafencing.com">fencing</a> and mild winters.</p>

<p>At the moment, Colin is trying to find as much time as possible amongst his busy work schedule to spend with his family.</p>
